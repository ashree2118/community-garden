            <strong>Lemons</strong> are bright, tangy citrus fruits known for their vibrant yellow color and refreshing
            flavor. They're
            rich in <em>vitamin C</em> and are often used to add a zesty kick to dishes, drinks, and desserts. Lemons
            also have
            natural antibacterial and antiviral properties, making them a popular choice for both culinary and medicinal
            purposes. Their versatility and distinct tartness make them a staple in kitchens around the world.

            <br><br>Sure! Lemons belong to the Rutaceae family and are believed to have originated in Asia. They were
            brought to Europe by the Romans and have been cherished for their culinary and medicinal uses ever since.
            Beyond their flavor-enhancing qualities, lemons are valued for their high acidity, which helps in preserving
            foods and balancing flavors. The zest of the lemon, which is the outer peel, contains essential oils that
            are aromatic and can be used in cooking and baking for added depth. Lemon juice is also a common ingredient
            in marinades, dressings, and cocktails, and it can be used as a natural cleaning agent due to its acidic
            properties.
